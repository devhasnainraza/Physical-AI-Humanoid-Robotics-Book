# Labs Section Introduction

Welcome to the hands-on portion of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook! This section provides practical exercises designed to solidify your understanding of the theoretical concepts covered in the main chapters. Robotics is an applied science, and there is no substitute for getting your hands dirty with code, simulations, and (where possible) real hardware.

Each lab is structured to guide you through a specific implementation, building foundational skills that you can apply to your own projects. We will primarily use **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** and **Gazebo/Isaac Sim** for our simulations, along with Python for scripting and control logic.

## Lab Prerequisites

Before starting any lab, please ensure you have the following setup:

*   **Universal Development Environment**: As detailed in **Chapter 6: IDEs & Development Environment**, you should have:
    *   **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)** installed with **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.
    *   **VS Code** or **Cursor** with the "Dev Containers" extension.
    *   **Docker Desktop** (for Dev Containers).
*   **ROS 2 Humble**: Your development environment should have ROS 2 Humble installed.
*   **Python 3.10+**: With `pip` and `venv`.
*   **Git**: For version control.
*   **NVIDIA GPU (Recommended)**: For faster simulation (Isaac Sim) and AI workloads (Isaac ROS).

## Lab Structure

Each lab will typically include:

*   **Objective**: A clear statement of what you will achieve.
*   **Theoretical Background**: A brief recap of relevant concepts.
*   **Prerequisites**: Specific tools or files needed for the lab.
*   **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Detailed commands and code snippets.
*   **Code Explanation**: Explanation of the provided or generated code.
*   **Verification**: How to confirm your solution works.
*   **Challenge Questions**: Open-ended questions to encourage further exploration.

## How to Approach the Labs

1.  **Read First**: Understand the objective and background before touching the keyboard.
2.  **Type, Don't Copy-Paste**: Manually typing the commands and code helps in muscle memory and understanding.
3.  **Experiment**: Change parameters, break the code, and understand why it fails. This is often the best way to learn.
4.  **Collaborate**: Discuss with peers, but ensure you understand the solutions yourself.
5.  **Refer Back**: Use the main textbook chapters as a reference whenever you encounter a concept you need to review.

Let's begin our practical journey into Physical AI!
