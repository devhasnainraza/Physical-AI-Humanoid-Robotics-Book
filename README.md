## About The Project

**Cortex-H1** is a comprehensive, university-level engineering handbook designed to bridge the gap between digital AI and physical embodiment. While the last decade was defined by Large Language Models mastering the digital world, this project focuses on the next frontier: giving digital brains a physical body.

This is not just a theoretical textbook. It's a hands-on, code-first guide to building the complete software and hardware stack for a new generation of intelligent, autonomous humanoid robots.

**This project covers:**
*   **🤖 Full-Stack Robotics**: From low-level motor control with ROS 2 to high-level reasoning with VLA foundation models.
*   **🧠 The "AI Brain"**: Implementing Visual SLAM, Navigation, and sensor fusion to build a real-time understanding of the world.
*   **🏗️ Digital Twins**: Mastering sim-to-real transfer with industry-standard tools like NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Gazebo.
*   **🏃 Advanced Control**: Implementing Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Whole-Body Control (WBC) for stable bipedal locomotion.

### Built With

This project is built on a modern, open-source stack to provide the best possible learning experience.

*   **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)**: The core static site generator, providing a robust and extensible framework for documentation.
*   **[React](https://react.dev/)**: For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
*   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: For a utility-first approach to styling, enabling the "VVIP" design.
*   **[Google Gemini](https://ai.google/gemini/)**: Powering the on-the-fly AI translation features.
*   **[ROS 2](https://ros.org/)**: The foundational middleware for the robotics software stack.
