## 🌍 Overview

This project bridges the gap between **Generative AI** (LLMs) and **Physical Robotics** (ROS 2). It provides a complete curriculum from basic motor control to advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

### 🧩 Core Modules

| Module | Focus | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Robotic Nervous System** | Middleware & Control | ROS 2 (Humble), Python `rclpy`, DDS |
| **2. The Digital Twin** | Simulation & Physics | Gazebo Harmonic, SDF, URDF |
| **3. The AI-Robot Brain** | Navigation & Perception | NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Nav2, VSLAM |
| **4. Vision-Language-Action** | Agentic AI | OpenAI Whisper, LangChain, Gemini |
