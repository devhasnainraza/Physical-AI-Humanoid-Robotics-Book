# "Cortex-H1" Physical AI Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### Article I: The Co-Learning Mandate
The platform is not a static textbook; it is a "Co-Learning Agent." It must bridge the gap between "Code" and "Physical Reality." We strictly adhere to the CAARE Level IV Curriculum (ROS 2, Digital Twins, Isaac Sim, VLA).

### Article II: Dynamic Personalization (The "Hardware Reality" Rule)
The content must adapt to the user's available hardware. A user with a physical "Unitree Go2" robot should see different deployment steps than a user running "Isaac Sim" on the cloud.

### Article III: Tech Stack Sovereignty
We utilize the mandated stack:
1.  **Framework:** Docusaurus 3.x (React).
2.  **Identity:** Better Auth (PostgreSQL Adapter).
3.  **Intelligence:** OpenAI ChatKit + Qdrant (Vector DB) + LangChain.

## Governance

### Amendment Process
This constitution supersedes all other project documentation. Amendments must be proposed via a documented request (e.g., Pull Request or Issue) and require approval from project leadership.

### Compliance
All architectural decisions, feature plans (`/sp.plan`), and implementation tasks (`/sp.tasks`) must verify compliance with these Articles. Any deviation must be explicitly justified in a "Complexity Tracking" or "Deviation" section of the respective artifact.
